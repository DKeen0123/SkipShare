# SkipShare

A small project to better learn and understand React Native and GraphQL.

## The Idea

Build an application designed to help builders and contractors better manage their waste and resources.

#### How?

The app will allow people to sell space in their skips that others can purchase to get rid of left over waste from a job.

## The Process

The MVP decided on was an application that would allow a user to advertise their skip, and leave a contact number and location, aswell as a description.

However, as User authentication was always going to be needed, I decided to start with this, so began by building the register/login form first.
